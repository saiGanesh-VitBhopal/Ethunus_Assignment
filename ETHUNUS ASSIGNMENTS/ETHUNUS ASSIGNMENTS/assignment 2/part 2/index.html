  <h2>Introduction to HTML</h2>

  <p>
    HTML (<em>Hypertext Markup Language</em>) is used to create document on the
    <a href="#">World Wide Web</a>.
    <em>It is simply a collection of certain key words called "Tags" that are helpful in writing the
    document to be displayed using a browser on Internet.</em>
    HTML was developed by <strong>Tim Berners-Lee</strong> in 1992.
